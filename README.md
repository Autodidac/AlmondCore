# AlmondCore
The Heart of the AlmondEngine is AlmondCore a Feature Complete Crossplatform Task and Component based Entry Point System with built-in Stateless Scene Management


### Advanced Features

- Singleton-free Modern C++20 Design
- Stateless Scene System
- Thread Safe Multithreaded TaskHandler
- Wait-Free Thread Queue for maximum efficiency in a high demand environments
- Hands-free Entry Point System, delete your basic templates and simply include the library- build scenes that are processed through the task system and contain your code in a modern C++20 programming environment (never think about (int main) again in your life)
- This is used as the core foundation for my 3D Graphics library - Game Engine - The Almond Engine - which is free under apache 2.0 license - it's the first in a series of modular stepping stones to create a suite of very powerful c++ tools free for public use.
- Component Pattern Based Design because it is intended for a game engine after all which allows for high extensability of the Entity Component System - ECS - which can be used like agents in a c++ program along side the scene system this provides practically more than you'd ever need or exactly just enough.
- Minimalist Functional Program Design Allows for High Efficiency and Scalability in any and all Environments with user friendliness being a focus feature. So it might seem bloated but actually be more efficient than some peoples current programming and it being very practical to use in any medium or large project, with opensource commercial friendly licensing you can simply custom tailor it to your liking. If you share it openly just remember to state your changes as per the license requirements for everyone to keep up with. - Happy Coding!
